Based on the above,answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item The frist member of the family draws a card at random and another member bets that it is an even prime number.What is the probability of his winning the bet?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item $\frac{2}{17}$
	\item $\frac{3}{17}$
        \item $\frac{1}{17}$
        \item $\frac{4}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
       \item The second member of the family draws a card at random and some other 
member bets that it is an even number. What is the probability of his winning 
the bet ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
        \item $\frac{7}{17}$
        \item $\frac{8}{17}$
        \item $\frac{9}{17}$
        \item $\frac{10}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that the number on the card drawn at random is 
divisible by 5 ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item $\frac{5}{17}$
        \item $\frac{4}{17}$
        \item $\frac{3}{17}$
        \item $\frac{2}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that the number on the card drawn at random is a 
multiple of 3 ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
        \item $\frac{5}{17}$
        \item $\frac{6}{17}$                                    \item $\frac{7}{17}$
	\item $\frac{8}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
