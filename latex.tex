\begin{enumerate}
	\item During the lockdown period,many families got bored of watching TV all the time.Out of these families, one family of 6 members decided to play a card game.17 cards numbered 1,2,3,4,..,17 are put in a box and mixed thoroughly.One card is drawn by one member at random and other family members bet for the chances of drawing the number either prime,odd or even etc.

Based on the above,answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item The first member of the family draws a card at random and another member bets that it is an even prime number.What is the probability of his winning the bet?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item $\frac{2}{17}$
	\item $\frac{3}{17}$
        \item $\frac{1}{17}$
        \item $\frac{4}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
       \item The second member of the family draws a card at random and some other 
member bets that it is an even number. What is the probability of his winning 
the bet ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
        \item $\frac{7}{17}$
        \item $\frac{8}{17}$
        \item $\frac{9}{17}$
        \item $\frac{10}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that the number on the card drawn at random is 
divisible by 5 ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item $\frac{5}{17}$
        \item $\frac{4}{17}$
        \item $\frac{3}{17}$
        \item $\frac{2}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that the number on the card drawn at random is a 
multiple of 3 ?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
        \item $\frac{5}{17}$
        \item $\frac{6}{17}$
	\item $\frac{7}{17}$
	\item $\frac{8}{17}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Two different coins are tossed simultaneously. Write all the possible outcomes.
			
\item A die is thrown once. Write the probability of getting a number less than $7$.
\end{enumerate}
\item  If the probability of occurrence of event E,\pr{E}=0.99, what is the probability of non-occurrence of the event E,\pr {not E}?
\item \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A bag contains 5 white balls and 7 red balls.A ball is drawn at random from the bag.What is the probability that it is either a white or a red ball?
\item Two coins are tossed together once.What is the probability of getting at least one head?
\end{enumerate}
\item Cards marked with numbers $1$,$2$,$3$,$4$, ..., $100$ are placed in a bag and mixed together throughly. A card is randomly drawn from the bag.Find the probability that the numbers on the card is
 \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item an even number,
\item a $2$-digit number,
\item a perfect square.
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
\item How many outcomes are possible when three dice are thrown together?
\item if \pr{E}=0.015, then find \pr{not E}.
\end{enumerate}
\item  During summer break, Harish wanted to play with his friends but it was too hot outside, so he decided to play some indoor game with his friends. He collects $20$ identical Icards and writes the numbers $1$ to $20$ on them (one number on one card). He puts them in a box. He and his friends make a bet for the chances of drawing various cards out of the box. Ench was given a chance to tell the probability of picking one card out of the box.

Based on the above,answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The probability that the number on the card drawn is an odd prime number,is
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]                            \item $\frac{3}{5}$                       \item $\frac{2}{5}$                       \item $\frac{9}{20}$                      \item $\frac{7}{20}$      
\end{enumerate}
\item The probability that the number on the card drawn is a composite number is
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item $\frac{11}{20}$                     \item $\frac{3}{5}$                       \item $\frac{4}{5}$                       \item $\frac{1}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\item The probability that the number on the card drawn is a multiple of $3$,$6$ and $9$ is
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]                            \item $\frac{1}{20}$                      \item $\frac{1}{20}$                      \item $\frac{3}{20}$                      \item $0$               
\end{enumerate}
\item The probability that the number on the card drawn is a multiple of $3$ and $7$is
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]                            \item $\frac{3}{10}$                      \item $\frac{1}{10}$                      \item $0$
        \item $\frac{2}{5}$               \end{enumerate}
\item If all cards having odd numbers written on them are removed from the box and then one card is drawn from the remaining cards, the probability of getting a card having a prime number is
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]                            \item $\frac{1}{20}$                      \item $\frac{1}{10}$                      \item $0$                                 \item $\frac{1}{5}$               \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item In a single throw of a pair of dice,find the probability that both dice have the same number.
\item A card is drawn from a well-shuffled pack of $52$ cards.Find the probability that it is not an ace.
